# MRS-robot-chase
Mobile Robot Systems course final project

Two teams of robots (police and baddies) are tasked with different objectives. The police know the live location of the baddies and need to get to a certain distance of a baddie robot toconsider it caught, ignoring it from there onwards. The baddies have the advantage of improved speed and must stay clear of the police for as long as possible. Show how the capture behaviour changes according to the difference in speed between teams and propose strategies to deal with that.

Extensions: The police will only be able to see the agents when in line-of-sight, and will instead rely on localisation/estimation of the baddiesâ€™ positions when out of range.
